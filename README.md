This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple game where you select numbers which add up to the number of stars displayed.  You can use 1 or several numbers to equal the total, it just has to be exact.  Once a number has been used, it can't be used again.  You get 5 redraws when you get stuck.  A redraw simply generates a new number of stars to use when you don't have a possible solution.  

The purpose of this game was to learn more about the React framework, states, classes, and components.
